# 1 WHAT IS R?

## 1.1 R in Context

In this section, we will discuss where R fits in the data science toolbox and its popularity among professionals.

### 1.1.1 Tools for working with data

There are many tools available for working with data, including spreadsheets and statistical applications such as SPSS and SAS. These tools offer user-friendly interfaces for data exploration and modeling. However, they may not be sufficient for all data tasks, especially those involving more complex questions or data formats.

### 1.1.2 Data-oriented programming languages

Data-oriented programming languages, such as `Python`, `Julia`, and `R`, offer greater control and power in analyzing data. These languages allow for more advanced statistical modeling and data manipulation.

According to the KDnuggets Poll of data mining professionals from 2019, Python is the most commonly used tool for data science tasks, with about two-thirds of respondents reporting it as their most common tool. R is also widely used, with about 50% of respondents reporting using it on a daily basis. Excel is also a popular tool, especially for basic data tasks.

It's important for data science professionals to be proficient in multiple tools, including R, Python, Java, C++, and SQL. R is a major tool for many companies and fields and is often the tool of choice for common data tasks.
