# 1 WHAT IS R?

## 1.1 R in Context

In this section, we will discuss where R fits in the data science toolbox and its popularity among professionals.

### 1.1.1 Tools for working with data

There are many tools available for working with data, including spreadsheets and statistical applications. These tools offer user-friendly interfaces for data exploration and modeling. However, they may not be sufficient for all data tasks, especially those involving more complex questions or data formats.

### 1.1.2 Spreadsheets for working with data

Spreadsheets, such as `Microsoft Excel` and `Google Sheets`, are ubiquitous and widely used for organizing and analyzing data. They offer flexibility in organizing data in a variety of formats and can sort, filter, count, and summarize data quickly. Spreadsheets can also create relatively sophisticated graphs and visualizations.

While spreadsheets may be sufficient for many real-world data tasks, they may not be suitable for creating more complex statistical models. In these cases, more sophisticated tools like statistical applications or programming languages may be necessary. 

### 1.1.3 Statistical Applications for working with data

Statistical applications, such as `SPSS`, `SAS`, and `Jamovi`, offer user-friendly point-and-click interfaces for data exploration and modeling. They are designed to handle large datasets and can perform a wide range of statistical analyses. These applications are commonly used in fields like psychology, social work, education, and business.

While statistical applications are a powerful tool for data analysis, they may not be suitable for all data tasks. For example, they may not be able to handle data that does not fit neatly into rows and columns. In these cases, a more sophisticated tool like a data-oriented programming language may be necessary.

### 1.1.4 Data-oriented programming languages

Data-oriented programming languages, such as `Python`, `Julia`, and `R`, offer greater control and power in analyzing data. These languages allow for more advanced statistical modeling and data manipulation.

According to the KDnuggets Poll of data mining professionals from 2019, 
- Python is the most commonly used tool for data science tasks, with about two-thirds of respondents using Python. 
- R is also widely used, with about 50% of respondents reporting using it on a daily basis. 
- Excel is also a popular tool, especially for basic data tasks.

It's important for data science professionals to be proficient in multiple tools, including R, Python, Java, C++, and SQL. R is a major tool for many companies and fields and is often the tool of choice for common data tasks.

| Tool | Advantages | Limitations |
|---|---|---|
| Spreadsheets | Ubiquitous, flexible in organizing data, quick and easy to sort, filter, count, and summarize | May not be suitable for creating complex statistical models                                                                |
| Statistical applications | User-friendly point-and-click interfaces, designed to handle large datasets, perform complex analyses | May not be able to handle data that does not fit neatly into rows and columns                                             |
| Data-oriented programming languages | Greater control and power in analyzing data, more advanced statistical modeling and data manipulation | Steeper learning curve, may require more coding expertise, less user-friendly than spreadsheets or statistical applications |
