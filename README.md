# Resource_Data-Wrangling-and-Visualization-in-R

## Introduction

In this course, we will learn how to work with data and how to find meaningful patterns in direction and data using R. R is a free open-source programming language designed to help you explore and model data to find the insight you need.

## Getting started with R

To get started with R, we need to install R and the RStudio environment. RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. We will also learn how to work with additional code packages that extend R's functionality.

You don't need to have any experience with R or computer programming in general to take this course. However, it is helpful to have some familiarity with basic concepts of statistical analysis. Either way, all concepts will be thoroughly explained as we go through the course.

## Data Wrangling and visualization

Data wrangling is the process of cleaning and transforming raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis. We will see how to manipulate data using different techniques such as filtering, sorting, and merging.

We will also learn how to create data visualizations using R. Visualizations help us to understand and interpret data in a meaningful way. We will see different types of plots and graphs that can be created using R.

Finally, we will learn how to adapt data to match our questions and chosen techniques. We will see how to reshape data using techniques such as pivoting and unpivoting.

By the end of this course, you will see the power and flexibility of R and how it can help you make the most of the data that's all around you. Let's get started with R Essential Training, part one, Wrangling and Visualizing Data.
